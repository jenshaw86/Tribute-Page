				<h2>About</h2>
				<hr>
				<p><span>Chien-Shiung Wu</span> was a Chinese-born American physicist so accomplished and highly respected by her colleagues that she was nicknamed the <em>First Lady of Physics</em> and the <em>Queen of Nuclear Research</em>. In fact, she was even considered to be the <em>Chinese Marie Curie</em>.</p>

				<p>Born in Jiangsu Province of China on May 31, 1912, Wu was raised by two uncommonly  progressive parents who strongly believed in the importance of women's education and founded the Mingde School for Girls where Wu attended elementary school. Wu was so successful in school that she was offered a place at National Central University in Nanjing. Later on in her educational career, she earned her Ph.D. at the University of California Berkeley.</p>

				<p>Wu was most well known for working on the Manhattan Project, as well as for debunking a hypothetical fundamental law of physics known as the conservation of parity. Despite her significant involvement in disproving the conservation of parity, her fellow colleagues, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for the discovery, and Wu's experiments and research went unacknowledged. However, she continued in her career toÂ be the recipient of a multitude of other scientific awards, including the National Medal of Science and the Wolf Prize in Physics, which she received in recognition of her contributions to disproving parity conservation.</p>
