			<h2>Her Story</h2>
			<p class="starting-letter">Chien-Shiung Wu was a Chinese-born American physicist so accomplished and highly respected by her colleagues that she was nicknamed the <span>First Lady of Physics</span>, the <span>Queen of Nuclear Research</span>, and if she <em>had</em> to be compared to anyone, she was considered the <span>Chinese Marie Curie</span>.</p>

			<p>Born in Jiangsu Province of China on May 31, 1912, Wu was raised by two progressive parents who uncommonly and strongly believed in women's education. Her parents founded the Mingde School for Girls where Wu attended elementary school. She later studied at Suzhou Girls' High, and she was so successful that she was offered a place at National Central University in Nanjing. Ultimately, she attended the University of California Berkeley where she completed her Ph.D. in 1940.</p>

			<p>Wu was most well known for working on the Manhattan Project and for debunking a hypothetical fundamental law of physics known as the conservation of parity. Although her fellow male colleagues, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for the discovery, Wu's experiments and research went unacknowledged. However, she continued in career toÂ be the recipient of the many other awards including the National Medal of Science in 1975 and the Wolf Prize in Physics, the second most prestigious award in the sciences after the Nobel Prize, in 1978 in recognition of her contributions to disproving parity conservation.</p>
